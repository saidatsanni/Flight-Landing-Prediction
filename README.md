# Flight Landing Prediction

**Motivation:** 

To reduce the risk of landing overrun.


**Goal:** 

To study what factors and how they would impact the landing distance of a commercial flight.


**Data:** 

Landing data (landing distance and other parameters) from 950 commercial flights. 
**There are multiple datasets used for the analysis**

1. ‘FAA-1.xls’ (800 flights)
2. ‘FAA-2.xls’ (150 flights).

**Statistical Techniques**


We consider statistical techniques and models such as:
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Variable Selection
* Regression Analysis - Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression - probit model, hazard model with complementary log-log link, and the logit model
* Modeling of Multinomial and Count Data
* Prediction and Model comparison and selection using ROC Curve, AUC values, AIC, and BIC criteria.
